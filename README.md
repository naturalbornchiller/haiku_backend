Haiku are brief, imagistic poems traditionally depicting—or at least alluding—to nature. Their lifecycle is tripartite within the reader - language --> image --> feeling - digested in unhurried succession. It is difficult to ascertain what elements (and doses of each) are necessary to produce powerful haiku, but there are a number of things that should be kept in mind. A haiku, by nature, should be a distillation of an experience; it is a mood and a moment in time. It should reflect a fresh way of seeing, should be childlike, unselfconscious. It should deal strictly in the immediate; any references to setting, mood, or metaphor must be smuggled in. References to interpretation of any kind should be omitted entirely. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the haiku's language should be resonant, natural, succinct. The poet pares away that which is supernumerary; what is left is haiku.

Kigo (季語 "season word") is a word or phrase meant to evoke the season that a poem is set in. E.g., cherry blossoms are a common spring kigo in japanese poetry, whereas the moon is strongly associated with autumn.
