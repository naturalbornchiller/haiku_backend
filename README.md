# What is Kigo?
This is an app that allows users to publish and read haiku! This repo hosts the back end. If you want to checkout the front end, click on this link: https://github.com/naturalbornchiller/haiku_client

# Development Process
For project 2, I placed immense primacy on form and "feel", as opposed to function. For the first day I worked on the rails api. After that though I spent the whole week working on html, css, jquery -- the interplay of each. This is my first time focusing on UX/UI, and I found it at once refreshing and maddening. There were so many tiny things—transitions, positioning, transformations, timing—that derailed me from creating 
a working MVP, and I wish I could have used my time better.

# Future Goals
I want to make the 'poems' page look extremely crisp; allow searching by title and author; create a timeline of ones own poems to view; allow for password change; restrict poem entry to haiku format; allow haiku to be favorited; for favorites to be retrievable; for haiku drafts to be stored; for haiku to be filtered by popularity. I'm mostly just spitballing here... but I really do want all those things.
